Task 1: Process Creation Utility


Write a Python program that creates N child processes using os.fork(). Each child prints:
- Its PID
- Its Parent PID
- A custom message
The parent should wait for all children using os.wait().



Task 2: Command Execution Using exec()
Modify Task 1 so that each child process executes a Linux command (ls, date, ps, etc.) using os.execvp() or subprocess.run().
Task 3: Zombie & Orphan Processes
Zombie: Fork a child and skip wait() in the parent.
Orphan: Parent exits before the child finishes.
Use ps -el | grep defunct to identify zombies.
Task 4: Inspecting Process Info from /proc
Take a PID as input. Read and print:
- Process name, state, memory usage from /proc/[pid]/status
- Executable path from /proc/[pid]/exe
- Open file descriptors from /proc/[pid]/fd
Task 5: Process Prioritization
Create multiple CPU-intensive child processes. Assign different nice() values. Observe and log execution order to show scheduler impact.

Expected Output:

- Child-parent process tree
- Executed system commands from child processes
- Verified zombie/orphan states using ps
- Process details from /proc
- Impact of priority using different nice values

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n) for n processes.
Space Complexity: O(n) due to maintaining process IDs and logs.

Practical Applications:
- Operating system kernel development
- Performance tuning via scheduling
- Real-time and embedded system programming
- Debugging tools and monitoring systems
